# Firefox Lockwise Browser Extension

The browser add-on repository for [Firefox Lockwise][org-website] prior to being integrated into Firefox 70+ (as about:logins).
We may use this repository in the future to bring Lockwise to other browsers via an extension but for now it is unmaintained.
Issues with the functionality built-into Firefox should be filed using the links at the top of the [Password Manager Wiki][pwmgr-wiki]. You can use your GitHub account for that.

## [Documentation][docs-link]

*This is just one component of the Firefox Lockwise product. Please see the
[Firefox Lockwise website][org-website] for more context.*

For detailed documentation and installation instructions, please see the
[`docs` directory][docs-link].
